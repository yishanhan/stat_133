## Step 1
BabyNames is the raw data from the US Social Security Administration. 

* A case is a year-name-sex, for example, Jane F 1992 is a case. 

Variables: 

* name
* sex
* count
* year

## Step 3

name        | popularity | year 
------------|------------|--------
Cora        | 1045       | 1880
Cora        | ...        | ...
Gertrude    | 787        | 1880
Gertrude    | ...        | ...
Myrtle      | 615        | 1880
Myrtle      | ...        | ...

* The variable `sex` does not appear at all 
* The variable `popularity` is similar to the variable `count` in the raw data table, but is transformed by giving the total portion of selected baby names over the total number of babies born in the given year. This gives us a more accurate representation of how popular the names were in a given year. 

## Step 4

* The cases in the glyph-ready table have been filtered out by the names for all years. 
* Yes, the cases have been grouped by `name` and `year`. We also summarised the `count` to find the sum of the `count` for when the `name` and `year` are the same. In this way, we can aggregate the count for the names that appear twice in one year due to different sexes.  
* Yes, the variable `popularity` has been introduced. The relationship between `popularity` and `count` is that `popularity` is the proportion of the count of `names` over the total number of babies born in each chosen year.  

## Step 5

1. Create a table for the baby names and filter by names of interest
2. Select the columns `name`, `count` and `year` 
3. Group by the columns of `name` and `year`
4. Add up the total of `count` for the names that are repeated in every year
5. Create another table based on the first `BabyNames` data table by grouping by `year`.
6. Summarise the total `count` of all names in a certain year. This allows us to find the total number of babies born in a certain year. 
7. Join the two tables by `year`
8. Create another column and call it `Popularity`, which is the proportion of number of `name` in a `year` over the total number of babies born. 
9. Join the two tables together and find the popularity of the names by dividing the count by the total number of babies born in the year

## Step 7
```{r warning = FALSE}
BabyNames3 <- BabyNames %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Cora", "Gertrude", "Myrtle")) %>%
  select(name, count, year) %>%
  group_by(name,year) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count))
BabyNames3

Total <- BabyNames %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(totalinyear = sum(count))
Total

Join <- BabyNames3 %>% 
  full_join(Total) %>%
  mutate(Popularity = count/totalinyear)%>%
  group_by(name,year) 
Join

```
## Graph of Cora, Gertrude and Myrtle
```{r}
Join %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= year, y = Popularity, group = name)) + geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.5, aes(color = name)) + ylab("Popularity") + xlab("Year") + theme(legend.position = 'top')
```
