## Question 8

newdata.csv will contain objects that contain the word "California", separated by commas, taking the columns 3 to 7 from the original data.csv file 

## Question 9

* +: 1 or more 
* *: 0 or more 
* ?: 0 or 1

## Question 10

* dddsn

## Question 11
This is a problem because the gsub of `<.*>` may take everything inside of <text>One<text> as one thing to replace with "". This would mean that all of above will just go to "", instead of having <>. In other words, this code does not take into account that `<.*>` has multiple parts to it.
