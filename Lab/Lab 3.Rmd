# Part 1 Frames, Glyphs, and other Components of Graphics

1. What glyphs are used? 
Line to show the different income groups 

2. What are the aesthetics for those glyphs? 
* X axis
* Y axis
* Position of the lines 

3. Which variable is mapped to each aesthetic?
* Income group is mapped to the facets and the position of the lines
* The portion of annual family income is mapped to the Y axis 
* Year is mapped to the X axis 

4. Which variable, if any, is used for faceting?
* Income group is used for faceting
* There are 5 facets 
* ie. poorest fifth of U.S. families, second-poorest fifth, middle fifth 

5. What are the scales?
* The percentage change in annual family income is shown by the length and height of the line - The greater the change, the longer the line

* X axis is the year, from 1971 to 2011 
* Y axis is the proportion of change in family incomes
* Position of the lines show the income group

6. What variables make up the frame:
* Income group
* Portion of family income
* Year

7. What are the guides?
* Income group shown by the position of the lines
* Portion of family income shown by the bold numbers
* Year is divided by 1971 and 2011 to show the changes in year

8. Write down what the glyph-ready dataframe looks like.

Income group         | Portion of income in 1971 | Portion of income in 2011 
---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------
Poorest fifth        |     42                    | 114
Second-poorest fifth |     19                    | 46
Middle fifth         |     13                    | 29
Next fifth           |     10                    | 19
Wealthiest fifth     |      6                    |  9


# Part 2 Data Wrangling
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
flights1 <-flights %>%
  select( carrier, distance, dep_delay, origin) %>%
  head(10)
flights1
```

## Output A
```{r echo = FALSE}
flights2 <- flights1 %>%
  arrange( distance)
flights2
```

## Output B
```{r echo = FALSE}
flights3 <- flights1 %>%
  filter(carrier == "UA")
flights3
```

## Output C 
```{r echo = FALSE}
flights4 <- flights1 %>%
  filter(carrier == "UA") %>%
  head(2)
flights4
```

## Output D
```{r echo = FALSE}
flights5 <- flights1 %>%
  summarise(total = mean(dep_delay))
flights5
```

## Output E
```{r echo = FALSE}
flights6 <- flights1 %>%
  select(carrier, distance)
flights6
```
