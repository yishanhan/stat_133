# Chapter 3: Classifying Expressions

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(name == "Arjun") %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```
* `BabyNames` is the data table
* Functions: `filter`, `summarise`, `sum` 
* Named argument `total` 
* string `"Arjun"` is a constant
* `name` and `count` are variables 

```{r}
BabyNames %>% nrow() # How many cases in the table
BabyNames %>% names() # The names of the variables 
BabyNames %>% head(3) # the first 3 cases 
BabyNames %>% str() # view of the first few cases and variable structure
BabyNames %>% tail() # shows the last few cases
```

# Functions and Explanations (Chapter 7)
## Frameworks

**3 types of functions:**

**1. Reduction function:**
* Input: variable
* Output: Scalar 

```{r eval = FALSE}
mean() 
sum()
n() #find how many cases there are

min() 
max()
median() 
sd()
n_distinct() # how many different levels are there among the cases

```

**2. Transformation functions:**
* Input: one or more existing variables 
* Output: a new variable 

Often mathematical operations
```{r eval = FALSE}
weight/height
log10(population)
round(age)
< 
>
== # matches exactly
%in% # is one of. eg. age %in% c(18,19,20)  or name %in% c("abby", "abe")
ifelse(age > 18, "voter", "non-voter") # if condition is true, then "voter", if not, then non-voter
```

**3. Data verbs:** 
* Input: existing data table
* Ouput: new data table

### Examples
#### Filter
```{r results = "hide"}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(year > 1990, sex == "F") # will pass through only those cases that pass ALL the test

BabyNames %>%
  filter(year > 1990 | sex == "F") # pass through either or 

BabyNames %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1980, 1990, 1991, 1995))
```

```{r}
BabyNames %>%
  filter(name == "Prince") %>% # filters by the name Prince
  rename(babies = name) %>% # rename the column 'name' to 'babies' 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% #groups by the year and sex
  summarise(total = sum(count)) %>% # creates a new column called total with the sum of all counts of each
  arrange(desc(total)) # arranges the total in descending order (highest on top)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  summarise(avg_count = mean(cyl)) %>% #creates new column with the mean of cyl
  mutate(ratio = mpg/cyl) %>% # creates new column called 'ratio' that gives the value for each row
  filter(mpg > 30) %>% # filters where this condition is true
  select(mpg, cyl) # selects the named columns 

```

## Join
```{r eval = FALSE}
left_join() # Output has all the cases from the Left, even if there is no match in the right
right_join() # Output has only the cases from the Left with a match in the Right 
full_join() # The output will have all the cases from both the Left and the Right
inner_join() # lets you choose the cases you want in that list 
```

```{r results = "hide"}
InfantMortality <- CountryCentroids %>%
  select(name, iso_a3) %>%
  left_join(CountryData %>% select(country, infant), by = c("name" = "country")) # left joins the DF Countrydata matching name to country

MigrationFlows %>%
  left_join(InfantMortality, by = c("destcode" = "iso_a3"))
```

## Wide and Narrow tables

`gather()` transforms wide into narrow
`spread()` transforms narrow into wide
```{r eval = FALSE}
BP_narrow <- BP_wide %>%
  gather(key = when, value = sbp, before, after) # Key and Value are default
# 'when' is the new column name. sbp column name, before and after in the when with the values in sbp

BP_wide <- BP_narrow %>%
  spread(key = when, value = sbp) # splits up the values of when into 2 different columns, their values in their columns
```

## Separate()
```{r eval = FALSE}
separate(key, into = c("Part", "Measure"), sep = "\\.") 
# separate the column Key into 2 columns, Part and Measure 
# separate by the .
# Can also do sep = "-"
```

## Apply
`sapply` 
* Takes in list 
* Returns vector, matrix, array 

`lapply` 
* Takes in list
* Returns list

`vapply` 
* Takes in list
* Returns vector, matrix, array 
* Need to specify FUN.VALUE = numeric(1)
