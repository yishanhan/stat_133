I downloaded the data from (http://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda) 

# **Basics**
```{r echo = FALSE}
load("Library-small.rda")
```

``` {r}
nrow(Bks)
nrow(Inv)
names(Bks)
names(Inv)
dim(Bks)
dim(Inv)
```
`nrow(Bks)` and `nrow(Inv)` show the number of rows in the `Bks` and `Inv` tables. 
`names(Bks)` and `names(Inv)` show the names of all the columns and rows in the `Bks` and `Inv` tables, respectively. 
`dim(Bks)` and `dim(Inv)` show the dimensions of the tables. 

# **The number of books with each different current status**
```{r echo = FALSE}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```

# **How many books have been checked out**
```{r echo = FALSE}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
``` 
The first column shows how many books have been issued and the right column shows how many times they have been issued.
