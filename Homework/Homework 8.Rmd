Addresses <- read.file("http://tiny.cc/dcf/street-addresses.csv")
```

### Start with ST|RD|ROAD
```{r}
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD)" # Line 1
LeftOvers <- # Line 2
  Addresses %>% # Line 3
  filter( ! grepl(pattern, address), # Line 4
          ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address)) # Line 5
```

* Line 1: Name the desired pattern we want as `pattern`
* Line 2: Create a new variable called `LeftOvers` 
* Line 3: Pipe in the data table `Addresses` 
* Line 4: Filter by `pattern` using the `grepl()` in the `address` column. Here, we are filtering by all the observations that do not contain the pattern. 
* Line 5: Filter by the words `"APT" or "UNIT" followed by digits in the `address` column. Here, we are filtering by all the observations that do not contain the pattern. 

### Add to ST|RD|ROAD

We want to find all the street endings and add them to the pattern.
```{r}
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD|CIRCLE|WAY|TRAIL|AVE|LN|DR|DRIVE|CT|COURT|PATH|BLVD|LOOP|SQUARE|PKWY|SQ|PLACE|PL|TERRACE|VALLEY|ALLEY|EDGE|RIDGE|CENTER|COVE|MEADOW|TRL|TRAIL|HWY|HILLS|OAK|POINT|LANE|PT|CIR|HALL|TR)" # Line 1
LeftOvers <- # Line 2
  Addresses %>% # Line 3 
  filter(! grepl(pattern, address), # Line 4
         ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address), # Line 5
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 6
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+BO", address), # Line 7
         ! grepl("BX[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 8
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+([[:alpha:]]+)", address), # Line 9 
         ! grepl("BOX+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 10
         ! grepl("PO[[:blank:]]+BO", address), # Line 11
         ! grepl("P[[:blank:]]+O", address), # Line 12
         ! grepl("PO[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address)) # Line 13
```

* Line 1: Name the desired pattern we want as `pattern`
* Line 2: Create a new variable called `LeftOvers` 
* Line 3: Pipe in the data table `Addresses` 
* Line 4: Filter by `pattern` using the `grepl()` in the `address` column. Here, we are filtering by all the observations that do not contain the pattern. 
* Line 5: Filter by the words `"APT" or "UNIT" followed by digits in the `address` column. Here, we are filtering by all the observations that do not contain these words. 
* Line 6 - 13: Filter by the `grepl()` and filter out all the observations that do not contain any variations of "PO BOX". 

### Count how many addresses there are of each kind of road word

Now, instead of filtering out all the `grepl()` with the patterns, we keep all the ones that follow the `pattern` that we have listed. We filter out all the other variations of "PO BOX". 

```{r}
pattern <- "(ST|RD|ROAD|CIRCLE|WAY|TRAIL|AVE|LN|DR|DRIVE|CT|COURT|PATH|BLVD|LOOP|SQUARE|PKWY|SQ|PLACE|PL|TERRACE|VALLEY|ALLEY|EDGE|RIDGE|CENTER|COVE|MEADOW|TRL|TRAIL|HWY|HILLS|OAK|POINT|LANE|PT|CIR|HALL|TR)" # Line 1
RoadWords <- # Line 2
  Addresses %>% # Line 3 
  filter( grepl(pattern, address), # Line 4
         ! grepl(" APT|UNIT [[:digit:]]+$", address), # Line 5
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 6
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+BO", address), # Line 7
         ! grepl("BX[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 8
         ! grepl("BOX[[:blank:]]+([[:alpha:]]+)", address), # Line 9 
         ! grepl("BOX+([[:digit:]]+)", address), # Line 10
         ! grepl("PO[[:blank:]]+BO", address), # Line 11
         ! grepl("P[[:blank:]]+O", address), # Line 12
         ! grepl("PO[[:blank:]]+([[:digit:]]+)", address)) # Line 13


RoadWord <- "ST|RD|ROAD|CIRCLE|WAY|TRAIL|AVE|LN|DR|DRIVE|CT|COURT|PATH|BLVD|LOOP|SQUARE|PKWY|SQ|PLACE|PL|TERRACE|VALLEY|ALLEY|EDGE|RIDGE|CENTER|COVE|MEADOW|TRL|TRAIL|HWY|HILLS|OAK|POINT|LANE|PT|CIR|HALL|TR"

RoadWord <- unlist(strsplit(RoadWord, "\\|"))
Number <- numeric(length(RoadWord))

for (i in 1:length(RoadWord)) {
  Number[i] <- length(grep(RoadWord[i], RoadWords$address))
}
Table <- data.frame(RoadWord, Number)

```

This table shows how many address there are of each kind of road word in order of number of appearance

```{r}
Table %>% arrange(desc(Number))
```
